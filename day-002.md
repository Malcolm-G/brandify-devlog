# Day 2 – 02/01/2026

- Added React Three Fiber and Drei dependencies
- Created a Canvas and added a T-shirt model in view
- set up lighting and some orbit controls from drei

Need to improve camera distance and model looks a bit blurry
Decal component documentation from Drei is kind of basic but can still reference `DecalGeometry` from Three if need more complexity
