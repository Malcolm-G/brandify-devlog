# Day 37 – 06/02/2026

- Updated the userId attribute to be a UUID instead of a Long. Had it as a Long at first as it was easier to work with but as userId is used a lot, its better I make the fix now before it really grows
- Checked the dependency arrays of the useEffects. Having functions that are not cached with useCallback is a problem if not watched
- When using design features, it's important to warn the user when they try reload a page as they would lose their changes. Used the [Window: beforeunload event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/beforeunload_event) for this.
