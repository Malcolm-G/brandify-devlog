# Day 1 – 01/01/2026

- Set up repositories for backend and frontend
- Backend initialized with **Spring 4.0.1**
- Frontend set up using **Vite** using **React Compiler**
- Frontend uses **rolldown-vite** a new rust-based vite bundler that will be the future default
- Switched Git workflow to use **SourceTree**. Eclipse has EGit which is easy to work with but VS Code's git tool isn't as enjoyable. Plus sourcetree is specialised and thus it can do so much.
- Added **shadcn/ui** for UI components. Decided to go with shadcn due to alr

Focused on getting the core tooling in place.
