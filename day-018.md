# Day 18 – 18/01/2026

- Got a basic render out
- Decided its better to work in blender first and hard set some things instead of fully relying on the scripts. Faster feedback that way
- The current rendering is quite slow on my pc (No GPU) may need render farms sooner than I thought for experimentation
