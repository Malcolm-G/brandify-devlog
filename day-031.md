# Day 31 – 31/01/2026

- Did research on libraries for frontend security and found that although 'react-oauth2-code-pkce' is very lightweight, it is quite limited on the features it has and requires a lot of manual coding. Opted to switch to '@axa-fr/react-oidc' as it has more features for working with OIDC and authentication.
- Read up more on react router. Turns out I always just used it in the declarative mode, which is the simplest mode. It has 3 modes: Declarative, Data and Framework. I will still work with declarative but it's good to know the extensibility of the library.
- Will use protected routes for enforcing authentication. (True security is only from the backend, I know)
