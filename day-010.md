# Day 10 – 10/01/2026

- Persisted state using zustand's persist middleware
- Learned about browsers IndexedDB API which is a transactional database system used for storage. Best for large items or when you want to use async to get data from storage
- LocalStorage and Session storage are synchronous when retrieving and updating data. Session storage is based on the current tab which is erased when you close the tab and localstorage persists when browser is closed.
