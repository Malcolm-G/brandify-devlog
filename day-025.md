- Bug where hibernate can't save entity with jsonB to database. Error states:

```
Could not find a FormatMapper for the JSON format, which is required for mapping JSON types. JSON FormatMapper configuration is automatic, but requires that you have either Jackson or a JSONB implementation like Yasson on the class path.
```

- Other users have experienced this before and needed to implement a custom hibernate customizer. Still checking how to do so with spring 4.0
