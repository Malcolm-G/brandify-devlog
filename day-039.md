# Day 39 – 08/02/2026

- Dealing with saving of logos and their images. I have unecessary controllers in the backend to deal with branding related requests.
- My zustand store should also be reworked. It can encapsulate all branding data instead of its current state
- If unauthenticated I'll just allow a branding per tshirt to be stored locally
